What is MVC?
------------
M - Model

V - View

C - Controller


-> MVC is an universal design pattern 

-> Using MVC design pattern we can develop loosely coupled applications

-> We can developer application in layered archicture in fashion

-> In this MVC design pattern

	M - model (It deals with Data layer)

	V - view (It deals with Presentaion layer) - UI

	C - controller (It deals with Web layer)

-> If we develope our application using MVC then maintenence cost will be less in future
--------------------------------------------

-> What is Spring MVC ?
--------------------------
Spring MVC is a module available in Spring framework

-> Using Spring MVC we can develope MVC based web application    & we can develop distributed applications

What is a Web application 
-------------------------
-> The application which we are accessing from browser

-> Web applications are meant for C 2 B (Customer to Business)

-> End users will interact with web applications directley

  Ex : Gmail, Flikart, Amazon, IRCTC etc....

What is a Distributed application
---------------------------------
-> The application which is interacting with another    application is called as Distributed application

-> To develop distributed applications we will use Webservices

-> Using Spring MVC we can develop and access REST APIs

-> REST API & REST Client both we can develop using Spring MVC

-> Distributed applications are meant for B 2 B
    (Business to Business)

    Ex : Passport ----> Aadhar app
         Zomoto -----> Banking apps
	 MakeMyTrip ---> Airlines apps

-> In Spring MVC, Components roles seperated very clearly    seperated

-> Spring MVC supports for multiple presentation technlogies

-> Spring MVC supports for Forms development (They provided their own form tag library to simply forms development)

-> Spring MVC supports form Form binding object

-> When we spring mvc for forms development it provides will things for us
         
        a)It captures form data
        b)It converts form data to corresponding data type
        c)It binds form data to java object and provided                 object directley
       
-> Spring MVC supports for I18N applications development

-> Spring MVC supports for Inteceptors to intercept every    request

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Spring MVC Components
---------------------
1) Front Controller (DispatcherServlet)
2) Handler Mapper
3) Controller
4) ModelAndView
5) ViewResolver
6) View

-> Spring MVC module is part of Spring framework

-> In Spring 1.x version we have Spring MVC and       Spring Web MVC modules

-> Spring 2.x version web module and mvc module are     combined and released Spring Web MVC module

-> Spring MVC module is used to develop below types    of applications

	a) Web applications
	b) Distributed applications

-> This Spring Web MVC module is developed based on     2 design patterns

	   a) MVC Design Pattern
	   b) Front Controller Design Pattern


FrontController
---------------
-> FrontController is responsible to perform pre-   processing and post processing of incoming    request

-> For example capturing form data we can consider    as pre-processing request

-> For example sending response back to client in    client understandable form can be called as Post    Processing of request

-> In Spring Web MVC based application we will use      DispatcherServlet as a front controller

-> DispatcherServlet is a pre-defined servlet          provided by Spring MVC module

-> Dispatcher will be called as Spring framework        Servlet

Handler Mapper
--------------
-> Handler Mapper is a pre-defined class available    in Spring MVC

-> Handler Mapper is responsible to identify request    handler(Controller)

-> The program which is handling incoming request is    called as Request Handler

-> Controllers will be called as request handlers

-> Handler Mapper will identify request handler and    returns handler details to DispatcherServlet

Controller
----------
-> Controller is a program which is responsible to    handle request

-> Using Spring MVC module we can create our own    Controllers

-> In Spring MVC some predefined controller classes    are available like below

	a)SimpleFormController
	b)AbstractCommandController
	c)MultiActionController etc...

-> We can create User define controller using   @Controller annotation

ModelAndView
------------
-> Once Request processing is completed Controller will return ModelAndView object to DispatcherServlet

-> ModelAndView is a pre-defined class available in    Spring MVC module

-> In ModelAndView class, model represents data and view represents logical view name

	Model -----> Holds Data

	View ------> Logical view file name

View Resolver
-------------
-> In Spring MVC we have multiple view resolver    classes+

	a)InternalResourceViewResolver
	b)URLBasedViewResolver
	c)XmlViewResolver etc....

-> These view resolvers are responsible to identify    view files  (location & extension)

View Component
----------------
-> It is responsible to render model data on view   file


Request Execution Flow In Spring MVC Application
------------------------------------------------
1) Incoming Http Request will be recieved by DispatcherServlet. DS is a predefined Servlet class in Spring MVC and it is acting as Front Controller.

2) DispatcherServlet will send requested URL to HandlerMapper

3) HandlerMapper will identify request handler which is responsible to handle this request and will send request handler details to DispatcherServlet.

4) DispatcherServlet will call respective Controller class method

5) Controller method will process request and will send ModelAndView object to DispatcherServlet

	Model ---> Data
	View ---> Logical File Name

6) DispatcherServlet will send view name to ViewResolver

7) ViewResolver will identify view location & extension and sends data to DispatcherServlet

8) DispatcherServlet will give model and view details to View Component

9) Model data will be rendered on view sends back to DispatcherServlet

10) DispatcherServlet will send response back for the recieved request

------------------------------------------------------------
-> When we create SB application by default start class will be provided

-> In Spring Boot, web app execution also will start from main method

-> For developing web apps using Spring Boot, we need web starter

-> web starter provides support for mvc, rest api and embedded container

-> Spring Boot will provide Apache tomcat as embedded container

-> In spring boot, default port no for embedded container is 8080

-> To change server port in SPringBoot we can use below property

		server.port = 9090

-> By Default Spring Boot will not consider Project Name in URL (   Context-Path)

-> Every method in controller should have unique url-pattern





----------------------HomeController----------------------------------
@Controller
public class HomeController {

	@RequestMapping("/home")
	public String displayHomePage(Model model) {
		model.addAttribute("msg", "This is home page0");
		return "homePage";
	}
}

URL to access : http://localhost:8082/07-SB-MultiController-Web-App/home

-------------------------DateController------------------------------
@Controller
public class DateController {

	@RequestMapping("/date")
	public ModelAndView displayDate() {
		ModelAndView mav = new ModelAndView();
		String msgTxt = "Hello, Today's date : " + new Date();
		mav.addObject("msg", msgTxt);
		mav.setViewName("displayDate");
		return mav;
	}
}

URL to accesss: http://localhost:8082/07-SB-MultiController-Web-App/date

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note : By default embedded cotainer wil not consider projectname in URL

-> If you add project name then we can't access resources

How to add Context-Path in Spring Boot application?
----------------------------------------------------

server.servlet.context-path=/App

Note: If we add this context-path, then it is mandatory to specify in URL to access resources.

Note: Context path willstart with / and it should not end with /


-----------------------------------------------------------------

-> When we add @RequestMapping annoation at controller method it will bind by default to 
   HTTP GET Request. Writing method=RequestMethod.GET is optional

	@RequestMapping("/index")
	public String index(){
		//logic
        }
		or

	@RequestMapping(value="/index",method=RequestMethod.GET)
	public String index(){
		//logic
        }

-> Note: The above two methods are same

-> One controller method can bind to multiple url patterns like below
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@Controller
public class DemoController {

	@RequestMapping(value = { "/", "/index", "/home" })
	public ModelAndView index() {
		ModelAndView mav = new ModelAndView();

		// set data to model in key-value format
		mav.addObject("msg", "Welcome to Spring MVC with Spring Boot..!!");

		// set logical view name
		mav.setViewName("index");

		return mav;
	}
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> We can send request to above controller method in below ways

	1) http://localhost:<port-no>/
	2) http://localhost:<port-no>/index
	3) http://localhost:<port-no>/home
	

Why we need to bind one method to more than one url-pattern?
------------------------------------------------------------
-> When user enters ---> www.facebook.com in browser login page should be displayed

-> when user click on logout --> login page should be displayed

-> Here for different requests we need to process with same logic

-> For this we can write our controller method like below

	@RequestMapping(value={"/", "/index", "/logout"})
	public String index(){
		//logic
	   return "index";
	}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> Every Controller method we should bind to unique url-pattern

-> In below scenario, both methods are binded to HTTP GET request and both are having "/home" as URL-pattern. In this situation DispatcherServlet will get confused which method it has to execute when request comes for "/home"
	
	@RequetMapping(value={"/", "/index", "/home"})
	public String index( )

	@RequestMapping("/home")
	public String home()

 -> Note: We can bind multiple methods to same url pattern if they are binded to     Different HTTP Request methods

	@RequetMapping(value={"/home"})
	public String index( )

	@RequestMapping(value="/home",method=RequestMethod.POST)
	public String home()

-> When multiple developers are working on web layer, there is a possibility to use same url patterns and same http request methods for more than one controller method which results ambiguity problem.

-> To avoid this problem it is recommended to specify URL pattern at class level also along with the method level.

	@Controller
	@RequestMapping("/demo")
	public class DemoController {
			//methods goes here
	}
	
	@Controller
	@RequestMapping("/user")
	public class UserController {										
	//methods goes here
	}
