Exception Handling : Eliminating scenarios of Abnormal Termination of Java Application.

It is helpful to make end-user (who uses our application) understand simple user friendly
ERROR messages, instead of showing the RAW Exception stack messages. 

Generally in Java, we use following keywords to handle Exception in a Typical Java Application.

1. throw  ( used inside a method / behaviour )                
	- to throw an Exception.

2. throws ( used along with the method declaration )        
	- to inform (Method Caller) / JVC(default exception handler) about the possibility 
		of an exception.

3. try{} ( used inside a BLOCK/Method definition{} ) 
	- to capture the raised Exception inside the Block of code, and pass to respective Catch{}.
	
4. catch{} ( used after try{} )
	- to catch / handle the Exception raised in the try{}

5. finalize{} ( used along with try{} or try{} and catch{} )
	- to execute the statements written in this block after try block 
		**( Executes irrespective of the Exception Raised in try{} is handled or not handled )

Exception handling in MVC projects / REST API :

We have 3 approaches since Spring 3.2 release,

1. Controller Based Handler
 
	- @ExceptionHanler(value = Exception.class) used inside @Controller class on a 
	  method that is meant to handle the raised Exception.
	  
	- Specific to one Controller.
	

2. Global Exception Handler 
   (Common handler to all the available Controller in the respective Application)

	- We define a class with @Controller & @ControllerAdvice annotations 
	  and define a method inside with @ExceptionHanler(value = Exception.class)  
	  method that is meant to handle the raised Exception.
	  
	- Common to all Controllers in the Application.
	
** User Defined Exception Handler **

	- First create a Class(for e.g. InvalidIdException) extending from RuntimeExcepion, 
	  and calling super(String) from its 1 parameter(String) constructor.
	  
	- Whenever a method Throws this User Defined Exception, 
	  handle it with @ExceptionHandler(value=InvalidIdException.class).
	  
	- We can add the same in Global Exception Handler, which will act as common handler for 
	all Controllers
