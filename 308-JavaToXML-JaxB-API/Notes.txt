Today's session : JAX-B API
------------------------------------------------

-> XML stands for Extensible Markup Language

-> XML governed by w3c

-> The initial version of xml is 1.0 & current    version of xml is also 1.0

-> XML will reprsent the data in elements

	ex: <id>101</id>

-> One element contains start tag and end tag

-> Every xml will start with prolog
	
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8">

-> Prolog represents processing instructions

-> Every XML should contain only one root element

------------------------------------------------
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8">
<student>
     <id>101</id>
     <name>John</name>
     <rank>101</rank>
</student>
------------------------------------------------
-> In the above xml we have 2 types of elements
	1) Simple Element
	2) Compound Element

What is Simple Element?
-----------------------
The element which represents data directley is called as Simple Element

Ex: <id>101</id>

What is Compound Element?
-------------------------
The Element which represents child elements is called as Compound Element.

 <student>
	<id>101</id>
 </student>

-> We can use attributes also in the xml

ex: <book-name type="java">Spring</book-name>

-> XML is intereoperable

What is intereoperability?
---------------------------
Language Independent + Platform Independent

->XML is the defacto standard to exchange data among applications in Webservices.

-> SOAP Webservices will support only xml format for exchanging data

-> RESTful services supports for xml and some other formats also like json.



JAX-B
------
-> JAX-B stands for Java Architecture For XML Binding

-> Using JAX-B we can convert java object into xml and xml into java object

Using JAX-B api we will perform mainly 2 operations
----------------------------------------------------
1) One Time operation

2) Runtime operations

What is Onetime operations?
---------------------------
Onetime Operation means desigining binding classes

Binding class will represent structure of the xml

The java class which represents structure of the xml is called as Binding class.

Note: We will create Binding class only one time.

What are Runtime Operations?
-----------------------------
-> Marshalling & Un-Marshalling are called as Runtime operations.

-> The process of converting java object into xml is called as Marshalling

-> The process of converting xml into java object is called as Un-Marshalling.

Note: These operations will happen when the application is running.

-> To perform Runtime operations Binding classes are mandatory.

Working with JAX-B
-------------------
-> JAX-B api & its implementation is part of JDK only

-> We no need to add any additional dependencies to work with jax-b.
